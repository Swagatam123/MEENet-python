Installation Guide
==================

Instructions for installing the python library ``MEENet`` and the command line tool of the same name.

.. _require:

Requirements
------------

To run MEENet you will need python >=3.6.0 (we have no plans to support python<=3.5).
We recommend to use `anaconda <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>`_ and the ``conda`` command to install dependencies limiting the use of ``pip`` to libraries not available on conda's main channel. (``pip`` can be used too but its dependency-managing might be less robust).
